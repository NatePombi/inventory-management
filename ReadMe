    --Inventory Management Console App

Welcome to the Inventory Management System a simple yet powerful console-based application that allows you to manage products in an inventory. You can add items, remove them, search for items, and view your full inventory all stored safely in a JSON file.

This project was built entirely using Java, with an emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming, clean architecture, and file based persistence.
